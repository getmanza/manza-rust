# Address CodeRabbit Findings: $ARGUMENTS

CodeRabbit produces many findings per PR. Some are real bugs, many are stylistic, some are stale (the code already moved on), and a few are wrong (CodeRabbit doesn't know our conventions).

The job: **verify each finding against current code, fix only still-valid issues, skip the rest with a brief reason, keep changes minimal, and validate.**

This is a thin wrapper over `/github-review-comments` that pre-filters to CodeRabbit's bot user and biases toward push-back over compliance. CodeRabbit is a useful second pair of eyes, not a style authority.

## Phase 0: Determine the PR

Number → PR. `#N` → strip `#`. Empty → current branch (`gh pr view --json number`).

## Phase 1: Pull CodeRabbit findings

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR>/comments \
  --jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "coderabbitai[bot]") | {id, path, line, body}'
```

CodeRabbit comments include severity markers (`🔴 Critical`, `🟡 Minor`, `🟢 Nitpick`, `⚡ Quick win`). Sort by severity — critical first, nitpicks last.

## Phase 2: Per-finding workflow

For each finding:

### 2.1 Read the actual code

```bash
# What the file looks like RIGHT NOW, not what CodeRabbit saw:
sed -n '<start>,<end>p' <path>
```

CodeRabbit comments persist across force-pushes. The cited line might already have been changed.

### 2.2 Verify the finding is still valid

A finding is **valid** when all four hold:

1. The cited code still exists as described.
2. The issue would fail a test, block a build, or cause a real bug — not just a style preference.
3. The fix doesn't conflict with `CLAUDE.md` conventions.
4. The fix is minimal — touches the cited lines and the immediate fix scope, nothing else.

A finding is **invalid / skip-with-reason** when any of:

- The code has already been changed.
- The "issue" is a stylistic preference rustfmt and clippy don't enforce.
- The suggested fix is more complex than the original code.
- The suggested fix would break a documented convention or test.
- The suggestion treats a symptom while we already handle the root cause elsewhere.

### 2.3 Apply

**Valid** → fix minimally:

- Don't refactor adjacent code.
- Don't "improve" formatting rustfmt already passed.
- Verify with `cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test` after each fix.

**Invalid** → skip with a reason in the reply.

### 2.4 Reply on the thread

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR>/comments/<comment-id>/replies \
  -f body='<reply>'
```

**Reply templates** (be specific — vague replies make CodeRabbit re-flag the same thing later):

- **Fixed**: "Fixed in `<sha>`. <one-line summary>."
- **Skipped — already addressed**: "Already handled in `<sha>` (HEAD shows `<line>`)."
- **Skipped — convention**: "Disagree — our convention is `<X>`, see `CLAUDE.md` § `<Y>`. Leaving as-is."
- **Skipped — out of scope**: "Out of scope for this PR. Tracked separately as `<issue/note>`."
- **Skipped — stylistic**: "rustfmt and clippy already cover what we want; this would add complexity for no behavior change."
- **Partial**: "Addressed `<part>` in `<sha>`; deferring `<part>` because <reason>."

## Phase 3: Commit + push

Group commits by theme, conventional-commit prefixes:

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "fix(<scope>): <one-line summary>

Addresses CodeRabbit feedback on PR #<N>:
- <finding 1 summary>
- <finding 2 summary>"

git push origin <branch>
```

One commit per theme. Don't squash unrelated findings — when one regresses, you want to revert one commit, not all of them.

## Phase 4: Verify

```bash
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test   # local verification before pushing
gh pr checks <PR> --watch    # CI green after the new commits
```

Confirm every CodeRabbit thread has a reply:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<PR>/comments \
  --jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "coderabbitai[bot]") | select(.in_reply_to_id == null) | {id, body: .body[:80]}'
```

## When to push back hard

CodeRabbit doesn't know:
- The Karpathy guidelines we follow (no speculative abstractions, surgical changes).
- Our snake_case wire format decision — it sometimes suggests camelCasing or typed structs. Bodies are untyped `serde_json::Value` on purpose.
- That manza-ruby is the reference implementation — sometimes it suggests "improvements" that would diverge from the shared contract (error kinds, signer vectors, cassette matching).
- The cassette-replay contract — it might suggest mocking HTTP or calling a live API, which breaks parity with the other SDKs and creates real transfers on staging. Never accept that.

When CodeRabbit suggests something that would violate one of these, push back with a one-line explanation. Don't capitulate to keep the PR quiet.

## Karpathy guidelines

Especially relevant:
- **Think before coding** — verify before fixing.
- **Simplicity first** — reject suggestions that add complexity for marginal gain.
- **Surgical changes** — only what the comment cites.
