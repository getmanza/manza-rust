## Models

**Models.** Sessions run on `opus` (Opus 5.5) with `fable` (Fable 5.1) as the advisor (`.claude/settings.json`). Fable is spent where judgment matters most: plans are written on Fable, the advisor is consulted at decision points (before choosing an approach, a schema or public API, a migration, a dependency, anything irreversible, and when a failure repeats), and the `fable-validator` agent checks every finished implementation before its pull request opens. Agents pin their tier by alias, never by full model ID: `opus` for orchestration, security, full PR review, payments and production debugging; `sonnet` for the implementation specialists and TDD; `haiku` for mechanical scans. Every spawned agent names its `model:`; one that does not runs on `sonnet` (`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`), never on the session's model. Plan mode cannot take a model of its own: it runs on Opus and asks the advisor.
